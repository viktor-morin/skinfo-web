                <b>1.1</b> You hereby grant us the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free right

                referred to

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>1.3</b> Users must not, and must not allow any third party to, publish UGC on the website which:
                <br>
                <br>
                <i> *has a disloyal or unlawful purpose and/or content (or promotes unlawful purposes), or is
                    technically
                    harmful
                    (including without limitation computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan horses, worms, harmful

                the
                User Terms, we may delete the UGC without any notice, and we - dependent on the character of the
                violation - may
                inform the violated party and/or the authorities of the violation. Our right to delete will not be
                conditioned
                on an explanation, although we will strive to inform the Registered User about the deletion and the
                reason
                hereof.

                consequence
                of the Registered User's violation of the User Terms or current legislation. The Registered User must

                and hold us harmless from and against any claim or loss due to third party claims against us resulting
                from the

                <b>3.1</b> We collect non-personal data in connection with the use of the Website, Service and App. Our
                processing of user data takes place under observance of our Privacy Policy. By accepting these User

                <b>4. Disclaimers</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Skinfo's ingredient data is based on information from authorities and organizations where chemists,
                researchers and
                business experts have provided relevant information on substances in cosmetics and skin care products
                which
                may benefit or pose a risk to health indirectly or directly, and other available information related to
                ingredients.
                <br>
                <br>
                The original ingredient list is available in the widget.
                <br>
                <br>
                Please note that information may change over time as new information on substances may be available and
                the
                content of products may also be changed by manufacturers. Therefore, always check that ingredients
                listed in the
                App, Website or Service match the physical product ingredient label (the latter is correctly listed).
                <br>
                <br>
                Skinfo does not have access to specific concentrations of the ingredients listed on products. The data
                is
                general without consideration to the concentration, based on the knowledge available to us regarding
                ingredients. We assume that companies follow the current EU and industry guidelines that are required to
                distribute their products. We are constantly working to improve information and welcome feedback.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some assumptions in the product ingredient list have been made on special occasions where
                unclear/missing
                information or misspellings have occurred in the product ingredient list. Initial descriptions from
                sources have
                been simplified to provide information in an easily understandable format.
                <br>
                <br>
                Customers to Skinfo can choose how transparent their ingredient list will be presented. Some ingredient
                data is optional such as concerns, which may not be presented in the widget. Visit <a href="https://www.skinfo.se/search" style="color:rgb(60,0,200); font-weight: bold;">Skinfo

                <b>5. Limitation of Liability</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>5.1</b> We shall in no case be held liable, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or
                otherwise for
                damages for the use of the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages,
                including
                (I) loss of profits, contracts, turnover, business, business opportunity, loss or corruption of data or
                recovery
                of data, goodwill, security breach resulting from a failure of third party telecommunications and/or the
                internet, anticipated savings or revenue (regardless of whether any of these are direct, indirect or
                consequential) (ii) any loss or damage arising in connection with liabilities to third parties (whether
                direct,
                indirect or consequential) or (iii) any indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential loss or
                damage
                whatsoever. Some states and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability
                for
                incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>5.2</b> Our total aggregated liability, including without limitation liability for breach of contract,

                tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, arising from or in connection with
                the user
                terms,
                our services will never for any and all actionable circumstances exceed one hundred
                dollars
                ($100.00).
                You further agree that no claims or actions arising out of, or related to, the use of our
                services or
                these user terms may be brought by you more than one (1) year after the actionable event. Nothing in the
                user
                terms
                excludes or limits either party's liability for matters which cannot be excluded or limited under
                applicable
                law.
                <br>
